# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08)

**Core value:** At a live show, with one thumb, in the dark, the user can see credible next-song predictions and log the setlist as it happens — fully offline once loaded.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — transition-matrix-model-backtest

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 02

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 🎯 (show-#1) requirements confined to Phases 1–5; Phases 6–7 may ship after show #1 without data loss (attendance auto-mark in Phase 4, export in Phase 5)
- Roadmap: DATA-05 (set-boundary exclusion) mapped to Phase 2 with the matrix builder, not Phase 1 ingestion — the exclusion decision lives where edges are emitted
- Roadmap: EVAL-04 (honest confidence framing) mapped to Phase 4 — it is a Show Mode UI behavior conditioned on Phase 2's backtest output
- Research: as-of-date must be a matrix-construction parameter from day one (Phase 2); set-structure capture and two-source trail design front-loaded into Phase 4 — all three are unretrofittable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1] Open schema items to instrument during full corpus ingest: multi-set `setnumber` representation, `transition_id: 4` meaning, tease notation location, silent filter-ignore gotcha
- [Phase 4] iOS PWA lifecycle is device/version-specific — plan a real-iPhone spike early (force-quit restore, wake lock on oldest iOS in friend group)
- [Phase 7] Canvas label rendering quality at ~250 nodes on small screens needs a spike
