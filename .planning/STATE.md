# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08)

**Core value:** At a live show, with one thumb, in the dark, the user can see credible next-song predictions and log the setlist as it happens — fully offline once loaded.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — live-sync-data-safety

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (live-sync-data-safety) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Executing Phase 05
Last activity: 2026-07-14 -- UAT Test 2 passed (automated browser drive); mockLatest harness + dismissal slot-freeing fix shipped

Progress: [██████████] 100% (7/7 plans executed)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 🎯 (show-#1) requirements confined to Phases 1–5; Phases 6–7 may ship after show #1 without data loss (attendance auto-mark in Phase 4, export in Phase 5)
- Roadmap: DATA-05 (set-boundary exclusion) mapped to Phase 2 with the matrix builder, not Phase 1 ingestion — the exclusion decision lives where edges are emitted
- Roadmap: EVAL-04 (honest confidence framing) mapped to Phase 4 — it is a Show Mode UI behavior conditioned on Phase 2's backtest output
- Research: as-of-date must be a matrix-construction parameter from day one (Phase 2); set-structure capture and two-source trail design front-loaded into Phase 4 — all three are unretrofittable
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: logSong snapshots setNumber from the show's currentSetNumber (not caller-supplied) for true set-structure snapshot semantics (SHOW-06)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: the trackedShows row itself IS the provisional dex-attendance record (D-02/DEX-01) — no separate table; showId reconciliation deferred to Phase 5/6
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: SHOW-04 catalog search is a pure core fuse.js wrapper (searchCatalog) over MatrixNode[]; empty query returns [], threshold/distance in config.search
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: added core package.json exports so the app can import @guezzer/core (first app->core import)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: OrbitCandidate = PredictionCandidate + tuningFamily so the render layer never re-touches the matrix; tuning color keyed off the exact core union (not the display label)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: matrix bundle-imported via @matrix Vite alias + ambient declare module; schemaVersion===1 guard returns a handled error sentinel, never an unguarded crash
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: useShowSession is the app's first useLiveQuery — Dexie is the single source of truth (no useState mirror of trail/tally); predictFan gated on currentSongId !== null so null never reaches the frozen core ShowContext
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: resolved the OrbitStage/AppShell no-scroll seam (Pitfall 5) via an AppShell scroll prop — #/show passes scroll=false for a non-scrolling full-height flex column
- [Phase 04]: ActionBar rendered in-flow (not fixed) to stack above the app BottomTabBar without overlap (04-05)
- [Phase ?]: 04-06: D-15 destructive split — one-tap Undo (no dialog) vs confirm-gated deleteEntry in TrailNodeSheet
- [Phase ?]: 04-06: CometTrail/TallyReadout are dumb components fed useShowSession live entries/tally; recompute after any edit
- [Phase 04]: 04-07: wakeLock.ts mirrors persist.ts (feature-detect + try/catch + never-throw) and VERIFIES the sentinel is actually held — an immediate release/rejection is treated as unsupported (defeats iOS <18.4 installed-PWA false-positive, Pitfall 1) → calm once-per-show WakeLockNotice, silent visibilitychange reacquire
- [Phase 04]: 04-07: gesture suppression is declarative CSS on the stage/action-bar scope (touch-action/overscroll-behavior/user-select, html/body overscroll-behavior-y none) — no preventDefault JS; relies on the 04-04 non-scrolling AppShell seam
- [Phase 04]: 04-07: End Show is a confirm-gated destructive commit (EndShowDialog → endShow → finalized/read-only, D-04); weak-fan softening needed no new code (already live in OrbitStage from 04-03, EVAL-04)
- [Phase 04]: 04-07: on-device SHOW-12/SHOW-13 verification (6 steps) deferred by user approval 2026-07-13 to the end-of-phase device human-verify gate — NOT skipped

### Pending Todos

- [ui] Fix truncated/oversized song-name text inside prediction orbs (esp. center current-song orb) — `.planning/todos/pending/2026-07-11-orb-song-name-text-truncated-and-oversized.md`. Non-blocking UI-polish; found on-device during Phase 04 device gate. (NOTE: referenced file missing on disk — pointer only.)
- [ui/pwa] InstallBanner should show once per app version, not on every reload — `.planning/todos/pending/2026-07-14-install-banner-reappears-every-reload.md`. Non-blocking; owner-reported during Phase 05 UAT Test 3 setup.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1] Open schema items to instrument during full corpus ingest: multi-set `setnumber` representation, `transition_id: 4` meaning, tease notation location, silent filter-ignore gotcha
- [Phase 4] iOS PWA lifecycle spike — RESOLVED 2026-07-13. All six on-device SHOW-12/SHOW-13 checks (wake-lock hold + silent reacquire + gesture suppression + weak-fan softening + force-quit restore + End Show finalize) PASSED on iPhone 16 Pro, iOS 26.3.1. See 04-HUMAN-UAT.md (status: resolved) and 04-VERIFICATION.md (status: passed). Residual non-blocking gap: the iOS <18.4 wake-lock false-positive fallback path was not exercised (test device is 26.3.1); logic is unit-covered — close out opportunistically if a pre-18.4 device becomes available.
- [Phase 7] Canvas label rendering quality at ~250 nodes on small screens needs a spike
