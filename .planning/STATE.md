# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08)

**Core value:** At a live show, with one thumb, in the dark, the user can see credible next-song predictions and log the setlist as it happens — fully offline once loaded.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — show-mode

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (show-mode) — EXECUTING
Plan: 6 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-09 -- Phase 04 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 🎯 (show-#1) requirements confined to Phases 1–5; Phases 6–7 may ship after show #1 without data loss (attendance auto-mark in Phase 4, export in Phase 5)
- Roadmap: DATA-05 (set-boundary exclusion) mapped to Phase 2 with the matrix builder, not Phase 1 ingestion — the exclusion decision lives where edges are emitted
- Roadmap: EVAL-04 (honest confidence framing) mapped to Phase 4 — it is a Show Mode UI behavior conditioned on Phase 2's backtest output
- Research: as-of-date must be a matrix-construction parameter from day one (Phase 2); set-structure capture and two-source trail design front-loaded into Phase 4 — all three are unretrofittable
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: logSong snapshots setNumber from the show's currentSetNumber (not caller-supplied) for true set-structure snapshot semantics (SHOW-06)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: the trackedShows row itself IS the provisional dex-attendance record (D-02/DEX-01) — no separate table; showId reconciliation deferred to Phase 5/6
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: SHOW-04 catalog search is a pure core fuse.js wrapper (searchCatalog) over MatrixNode[]; empty query returns [], threshold/distance in config.search
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: added core package.json exports so the app can import @guezzer/core (first app->core import)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: OrbitCandidate = PredictionCandidate + tuningFamily so the render layer never re-touches the matrix; tuning color keyed off the exact core union (not the display label)
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: matrix bundle-imported via @matrix Vite alias + ambient declare module; schemaVersion===1 guard returns a handled error sentinel, never an unguarded crash
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: useShowSession is the app's first useLiveQuery — Dexie is the single source of truth (no useState mirror of trail/tally); predictFan gated on currentSongId !== null so null never reaches the frozen core ShowContext
- [Phase ?]: Phase 4: resolved the OrbitStage/AppShell no-scroll seam (Pitfall 5) via an AppShell scroll prop — #/show passes scroll=false for a non-scrolling full-height flex column
- [Phase 04]: ActionBar rendered in-flow (not fixed) to stack above the app BottomTabBar without overlap (04-05)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1] Open schema items to instrument during full corpus ingest: multi-set `setnumber` representation, `transition_id: 4` meaning, tease notation location, silent filter-ignore gotcha
- [Phase 4] iOS PWA lifecycle is device/version-specific — plan a real-iPhone spike early (force-quit restore, wake lock on oldest iOS in friend group)
- [Phase 7] Canvas label rendering quality at ~250 nodes on small screens needs a spike
